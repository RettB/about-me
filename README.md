# About Me

## Before GA:

I graduated ASU with BS in Sustainability with a focus on renewable energy, materials, and technology and a Minor in Global Studies. I worked for Cabela's Social Compliance department for 15ish months making sure their products were being manufactured responsibly and collecting and reporting on Conflict Minerals compliance data.

## Outcomes support I need:

Lots.

Networking.
Resume and Cover Letters.
Interviewing - I usually get a phone interview and maybe a first interview but not a job. 
Branding.

## Day 1 Goals:

Please elaborate?

## Two Truths and a Lie

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I'm not too picky but I don't want to work for a large corporate beige cubicle farm. Business casual Friday should not be the most exciting thing about working there. Jeans and a tshirt dress code would be prefered. Agency, product, and/or startup all sound interesting in their own ways but freelancing would be cool too. Would very much prefer flexible working options with the ability to travel and work from anywhere with a wifi connection. 

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
Full Stack Web Developer. (and designer?). I'd like to learn more about the design side after this course. I like photography and videography so including that or leaning creative in general would be great. So, Full Stack Web Developer and Designer "unicorn".
